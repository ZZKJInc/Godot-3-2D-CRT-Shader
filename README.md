# Godot 3 2D CRT Shader

A 2D shader for Godot 3 simulating a CRT.

![A 2D shader for Godot 3 simulating a CRT - OFF](/example-images/example-crt-off.png)
![A 2D shader for Godot 3 simulating a CRT- ON](/example-images/example-crt-on.png)

## Usage

* Create a `CanvasLayer`.
* Add a `ColorRect` as a child node of the `CanvasLayer`.
* In the `ColorRect` properties:
  * Go to the **Material** section.
  * Click on the `[empty]` **Material** and load `crt_material.tres`.

If, for for reason, when loading the `crt_material.tres`, the `crt.shader` is empty, just open it with any text editor, copy the code in the **Shader** editor and save it.
